# NTHU CS 5154 Hardware Security 2024 Spring

This repository holds some of my works in the course "Hardware Security" offered in National Tsing Hua University.

## Programming Assignment 1, 2

I have no plan to upload my works for the first two assignments.

## Programming Assignment 3

My assignment 3 was labeled as "worth watching" （值得觀摩） on eeclass. However, my report was not quite finished; there were, for example, a few missing figures or sections. Therefore, I added the missing part and uploaded the enhanced version of the report here.
